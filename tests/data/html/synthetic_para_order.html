        1. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com and
        announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view" was codified in
        its first months.
    </p>
    <p>2. Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing.
        By August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 8,000 articles. On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had over 13,000 articles.
        By the end of 2001, it had grown to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions.

    <p>3. Sanger coined its name, a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia. There was only the English language version
        initially, but it quickly developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing
        practices. With 5,330,401 articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia
        encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia consists of more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages
        and, as of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.

    <p>4. In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and
        Wikipedia, and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached Encyclopædia Britannica's.
        Criticism of Wikipedia includes claims that it exhibits systemic bias, presents a mixture of "truths,
        half truths, and some falsehoods", and that, in controversial topics, it is subject to manipulation and spin.

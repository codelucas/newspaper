As a result of rape, she gave birth to her daughter Zoe Slater at the age of 13.

However, Kat pretended to be her sister until the secret was revealed years later after Zoe said she wanted to live with Harry in Spain.

Kat, played by Jessie Wallace, will be drawn to helping the investigation after discovering that she has been left money in his will.

She then confides in her husband who believes that the heart-to-heart means a reunion is possible. Struggling to cope, Kat has a one-night stand in an attempt to take her mind off the situation.

A show insider told The Sun: "EastEnders has a rich history of tackling difficult social issues and Kat's continued story is one of these."

Played by the late Michael Elphick, Harry passed away off screen when he suffered a heart attack.

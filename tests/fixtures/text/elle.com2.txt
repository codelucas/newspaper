Ah, the holidays: A time for gift giving, family gathering, and passive aggressive rage flames. Here are some well-meaning but totally backhanded digs we heard over the holidays. Add your own in the comments. It feels good to vent.

From: Grandma

What she said: "Wouldn't it be nice to be in a relationship so you don't have to have roommates anymore?"

What we said: "I like my apartment; did Mom show you the new bar cart I found?"

What we wanted to say: "Literally the only thing harder than finding an affordable apartment in New York City is meeting a guy good enough to make you move out of it. If you know of a site that lists cute 1-bedrooms stocked with single guys, send it the hell over."

From Mom:

What she said: "It would be so nice to have some babies around here soon to open presents!"

What we said: HAHAHAHAHAHA.

What we wanted to say: HAHAHAHAHAHA.

From Aunt:

What she said: "Have you heard of this thing called Tinder?"

What we said: "Um, yes, kind of."

What we wanted to say: "If I hadn't heard of Tinder, I wouldn't have touched a male in over a year. So. Yes, yes I have."

From: Mother in Law:

What she said: "Did you REALLY cook all this yourself?"

What we said:" I sure did, hope you enjoy!"

What we wanted to say: "Just because Im not giving up my career to cook three meals a day for your precious angel of a son doesnt mean I cant figure out which end of the turkey is which, lady."

From: Mom

What she said: "Maybe its time to see a therapist."

What we said: "Yeah, maybe that could help."

What we wanted to say: "I am already seeing a therapist to try and resolve my relationship issues before Im doomed to die alone, THANKS!"

From: Mom:

What she said: "Did you go outside at all today?"

What we said: "Oh, haha, I guess I haven't!"

What we wanted to say: *crawls back under covers, fighting back shame waves*

From: Brother

What he said:"If she can wear that, then I dont have to get dressed."

What we said: "Then dont get dressed."

What we wanted to say: "Then dont get dressed."

From a STRANGER at a Christmas party:

What she said: "I lived in New York and would have worked forever, like you, if my husband hadnt moved us to Virginia. But really, you cant work forever and wait to have kids. You should do Match.com. My sister did Match.com and shes 42 and just got married and had a baby."

What we said: *Awkward polite laughter*

What we wanted to say: "Save some of that white wine for the rest of us "

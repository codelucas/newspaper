Blair Waldorf who? The headband has come a long way from its schoolgirl reputation, thanks to the recent efforts of the always-stylish Taylor Swift. When she recently stepped out in NYC wearing a sparkly hair accessory, she demonstrated three must-know rules to follow when pulling off the accessory:

Keep Your Hair’s Movement: Unless you’re fighting with grown-out bangs, refrain from pulling your headband straight back. Instead, keep your hair’s natural movement by placing your style on top of the hair, not under and behind the ears.

Go Easy on Styling: The simplest way to keep the accessory from looking stuffy is to skip elaborate updos and ringlet curls. Keep the hair more natural and use the headband to add structure.

Make It the Focal Point: With a piece of bling like Taylor’s, keep the rest of the beauty look soft. Although she wore fuchsia lipstick, the singer opted for a matte variety to tone-down the vivid hue.

Ahhh, at last, Memorial Day weekend. The sweet sweet reminder that summer has officially arrived. It's just crab cakes and football straight through Labor Day, right? Yeah. Well, if you find yourself celebrating the return of the season with a road trip, but have yet to pack, we've got your back. You'll be traveling with everything you need in no time. All you have to do is pay close attention to the following.



First, make sure your trusty weekender is ready to go. If you're bringing a suit, better go with a garment bag.

Grab your toiletry kit, a 3-day weekend is not the time to let your skin down.

Make sure you bring sunscreen. It's about your health, it's important.

Don't just throw everything in your weekender, guys. There's an art to folding. Learn it. Live it. Love it.

Planning on going for a swim? You'll need one of these. Not the board shorts you bought a few summers ago. Forget about those. Forever.

Skip the running shoes, you don't need those when you've got this.

Throw in a good book for the beach, the train, or wherever.

And remember, don't show up at somebody's house empty-handed.

Lady Gaga's no stranger to the world of beauty, having worked on a MAC makeup collection before releasing two of her own fragrances. Now she's dipping her heel into the realm once more as the face of Shiseido's 2015 New Year's ad campaign.

Not only that but Gaga turned her hand to photography for the Japanese beauty brand, shooting the campaign images herself. And yes, that means selfies ahoy!

50 selfies to be exact. According to WWD, the pop star shot a different image for a whooping 50 different Japanese newspapers. And it's no surprise considering selfies have dominated social media in 2014 and there's no doubt Gaga's had plenty of practice - have you seen her selfie-packed Instagram profile? Exactly.

Each image will appear across the New Year's busy shopping period, encouraging shoppers to look as selfie-perfect as Gaga and we have every faith they'll be as wacktacular as ever. Sadly, Shiseido has no plans to publish the campaign outside of Japan but if you'd like to see Gaga's 50 selfies, they're due to be released on the brand's website in the New Year. Failing that, we're sure one or two will pop up on Instagram.

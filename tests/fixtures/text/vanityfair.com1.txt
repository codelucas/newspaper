Say what you will about Gwyneth Paltrow, the Oscar winner proved to be a pretty great hang when she stopped by Howard Stern’s Sirius XM radio show on Wednesday. Unlike other actors, Paltrow was game to discuss anything that the host asked about, whether it was her high-profile “uncoupling” from Chris Martin, the sexual advice she gave Chelsea Handler, or her past relationships with A-list actors.

On the last subject, Paltrow opened up about Brad Pitt, whom she started dating after co-starring with him in David Fincher’s 1995 thriller Seven. “I definitely fell in love with him,” she said of her former fiancé. “He was so gorgeous and sweet. I mean, he was Brad Pitt.”

Paltrow was not the only person to fall in love with him at the time—she revealed that her parents were equally smitten with the star. “My father was so devastated when we broke up,” she said. “My father loved him like a son.” Although she refused to confirm that she dumped Pitt, she did talk about why the relationship didn’t end up working out.

“I was such a kid,” she shared. “I was 22 when we met. It's taken me until 40 to get my head out of my ass. You can't make that decision when you're 22 years old . . . I wasn't ready, and he was too good for me . . . I didn't know what I was doing.” Although she doesn’t still “hang out with” Pitt, Paltrow said that they are “friendly” if they run into each other.

The Goop founder offered slightly less glowing remarks about Ben Affleck, whom she dated and co-starred with in the 2000 drama Bounce.

“He was not in a good place in his life to have a girlfriend,” the actress said of their time together, before suggesting that both her friends and her parents were supportive of her decision to break up with him. When Stern asked about a comment Paltrow previously made about Affleck—specifically, “He’d be better off dating a Scores stripper”—Paltrow laughed, “Well that was true at the time.”

Paltrow said that she approves of Affleck’s wife, Jennifer Garner, though, and has spent some time with her. “Not only is she beautiful [but] she is so warm and she cooks and is so into her kids. And she’s hilarious . . . I had a girl’s dinner before the summer and she came over. She’s my neighbor. I really like her a lot.”

Paltrow also opened up about her friends Jay Z and Beyoncé, saying, “They’re the greatest people. They are funny and sweet and they’re self-aware and they’re really intelligent.” When Stern asked whether Paltrow called them after the Solange elevator incident to check in, Paltrow revealed, “If any of my friends ever have anything like that, I call right away. If someone’s clearly going through something, I always go straight to it.”

And on the subject of Johnny Depp, with whom she co-stars in the upcoming Mordecai, she said, “I just felt like I am not cool enough [for him]. He’s got all of his tattoos and his cool clothes . . You go into the room to rehearse and he is rolling his own cigarettes . . . He listens to music while he acts. He has a little [earbud] in his ear and he listens to music. It’s so cool. He’s creating the whole world in his head.”

Chia seeds and goji berries are the new kale and quinoa, according to Google's recent parsing of food-focused searches from 2014. Each year, the search giant pours through some of our more fascinating queries to come up with their Year in Search.

Some of the other more interesting food-related data points include:

Pizza was searched more than the World Cup.

The Cronut rose to 17th on the global recipe list after its arrival last year.

Our favorite ways to eat eggs are: 1) Deviled, 2) Scotch, 3) Scrambled, 4) Pickled, 5) Boiled.

This year we searched for 'recipes' less and 'restaurant' significantly more.

Our top slimming questions were 'how many calories should i eat in a day' and 'how to lose weight,' and the Paleo diet was the top searched way to trim down.

Foodies in Japan searched French food more than France.

Hungry folk in Australia searched Argentine food more than Argentina.

Spice-loving Brits searched Indian food more than India.

In 2014 'i am hungry' was searched a button-popping 7x more than 'i am thirsty.'

Oh, and nine million people watched a tiny hampster eating a tiny burrito.

The lesson, as always: you are what you search.

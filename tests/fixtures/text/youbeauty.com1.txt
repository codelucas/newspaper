NailSpin

The joint elevation of fan culture and nail art has left us with something magical: Drake nail decals. It doesn’t stop there – you can now wear your favorite '90s TV characters and even movie quotes on your nails with pride. Although its a personal style game changer, it all costs less than $10.

Here are our top five picks and recommendations of totally appropriate places to wear them. But remember the Internet is a wonderland, so don’t stop until you find your own favorite pop culture moment:

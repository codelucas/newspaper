Police have released surveillance photos in hopes of garnering help to track down a suspect in the University Bank robbery on Dec. 22.

Although the photos do not show clear images of the suspectâ€™s face, they show what appears to be a white male in dark colored clothing.

The man is described as being in his 20s, about 5 feet 11 inches tall and 200 pounds, Ann Arbor Police Department Detective Lt. Robert Pfannes said. He is described as wearing dark rimmed glasses, a dark grey or khaki hooded sweater, black pants and white gym shoes.

He was wearing an open-face knit ski hat that encircled his face.

The robbery took place at about 3:15 p.m. Dec. 22 when a man entered University Bank at 2015 Washtenaw Avenue and handed a note to a bank teller, Pfannes previously said.

The note implied the suspect, described as a white male, had a weapon and demanded money, he said. After taking money, the man then fled on foot.

The man may have then entered a car in 2100 block of Washtenaw, Pfannes said Monday.

Those with information on the bank robbery are asked to contact the Ann Arbor Police Department tip line at 734-794-6939 or e-mail TIPS@a2gov.org.

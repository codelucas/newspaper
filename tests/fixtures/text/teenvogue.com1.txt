As you may remember from High School Musical or Camp Rock or The Cheetah Girls, Disney Channel Original Movies aren't just made-for-TV movies, but actual events. Like something you looked forward to forever because it was basically like being at the exciting opening night showing, only in your own home.

Not that the recent DCOM selection isn't great and all, but we definitely suggest locating these movies over holiday break and watching them over and over again. Scrunchies and roll-on body glitter optional.

The boyfriend of sexy “Mob Wives” star Natalie Guercio is suing the Brooklyn club where he was brutally slashed by a box cutter-wielding assailant, the Daily News has learned.

London Rene is alleging Club Output's "inept" and "incompetent" security was negligent in failing to provide proper safety for its patrons on Dec. 28 when he was attacked outside the Williamsburg nightspot.

Rene's lawyer Scott Rynecki said there was "little or no security" watching over the club, which has a capacity of 600-persons.

The suit, which will be filed Thursday in Brooklyn Supreme Court, seeks unspecified monetary damages for Rene's physical and emotional scars. The court papers also name the security guard firm hired by the club.

"When I look in the mirror I'm angry," Rene, 37, said Wednesday. "I'm scarred for life; the scars are going to be there until the day I die."

The alleged slasher, Rodolfo Lopez, fled the scene and later surrendered to the NYPD.

Rene's face and torso were cut in the attack. Guercio, whose family owns a funeral home in Philadelphia where mobsters and their families were laid out, witnessed the slashing but she was not hurt.

"Any one of us could have been a victim," she said.

There was no listed phone number for the club.

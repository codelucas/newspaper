On Saturday, I went to volunteer at the Operation Care International’s Christmas Party For Jesus at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, and being directionally impaired, I got lost and had no idea where to park.

I saw two female Dallas police officers and rolled down my window to ask about parking. Upon rolling down my window, the antler on my window fell off. Not wanting to backtrack and tie up traffic, I drove off leaving the antler on the street. I found the parking meter lot that the officer had given me directions to, but then realized I had no change.

I was standing by the meter figuring out how to pay when I hear someone saying, “Hey, you lost your antler.” I turned around, and the female officer was in her squad car holding out the antler that had fallen off my window. I went over and got my antler, explaining that I was figuring out how to pay for parking because I had no change. The officer said they had just announced that they would not be giving out parking-meter ticket violations that day during the event hours. I’m thankful to our Dallas Police Department for all they do.

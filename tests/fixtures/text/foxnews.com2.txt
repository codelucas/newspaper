In a page taken from the most gruesome of books, a 17-year-old girl from Reynosa, Mexico lured an 8-months-pregnant woman to her home and killed her to try and steal her unborn baby.

Nathaly Cartas Leon, 20, had “met” Guadalupe Salinas Hernández on Facebook and had gratefully accepted her offer to give the mom-to-be a few baby items she needed. They met at a mall and then went to Salinas’ home, where she said she had more stuff to give her.

Once there, investigators said, Salinas beat Cartas to death with a blunt object and then proceeded to open her belly with a kitchen knife. The motive, police said: obsessive love. According to authorities, Salinas had an abortion back in June and had not told her boyfriend, who still believed she was pregnant and was looking forward to the birth.

It is not clear whether Salinas’ abortion was intentional or not.

After the gruesome killing and removal of the newborn, the teen hurried to the hospital and tried to save him, claiming the child was stillborn at home. But the fetus had stopped breathing when her mother died and could not be saved.

It didn’t take much for the doctors at the hospital to realize that the baby had not come from Salinas’ womb and they contacted police.

“I don’t regret it, I don’t regret,” local newspapers quote Salinas as saying. The body of the young mother was found in a shrub close to the killer’s house. Investigators are still trying to determine if she had an accomplice.

Reynosa is a border city in the northern part of Tamaulipas, Mexico. It is located on the southern bank of the Rio Grande, directly across the border from Hidalgo, Texas.

The Onondaga Historical Association leads groups through the Hotel Syracuse today on Historic Ghostwalks from 1 - 3:30 p.m. In what's subtitled 'Suite Stories' people tour many of the public spaces at the hotel as actors play personalities from the hotel's past. The building opened in 1924 and many famous names have been guests. A feature of the event is a view of Carl Roters 40 foot mural above the registration desk which has been covered with mirrors for the last 37 years.

Here's an update from the OHA :

• There are no walk-ins allowed

• There are a limited amount of tickets being added today, December 29th, at 2 P.M. for the January 3rd tours.

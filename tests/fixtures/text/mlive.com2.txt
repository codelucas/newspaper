GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Here we go again.

Star defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh drew the ire of the Green Bay Packers on Sunday after he stepped on quarterback Aaron Rodgers during the second half of the Detroit Lions' 30-20 loss at Lambeau Field.

The NFL is expected to review the play Monday, according to MMQB's Peter King. Suh probably will not be suspended, but given his extensive track record for in-game safety violations, anything is possible.

This comes just one week after Dominic Raiola drew a one-game suspension for stomping on Chicago's Ego Ferguson. And though Suh's play was less violent than Raiola's -- which actually forced Ferguson from the game -- it also looked like it could have been intentional.

Suh is seen stepping on Rodgers' left leg once, then reapplying pressure again, lifting up with the off foot to apply his weight to Rodgers' leg.

Rodgers, who already had left the game once with a calf injury, shoved Suh in the back of the leg after the play.

"He'll probably say it was an accident -- he was getting blocked into (me)," Rodgers said after the game. "But we'll see."

What did Suh say after the play?

"He was running off the field. I was talking to (referee) Walt (Anderson), actually. My calf and my ankle were getting stepped on, so we'll see what happens."

Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy was much less diplomatic, going so far as to call Suh's play "ridiculous."

"There's no place for that," McCarthy said.

Suh skipped his postgame obligations -- a violation of league rules -- but coach Jim Caldwell vouched for him after the game.

"I didn't see it, and I don't think it was intentional, either," Caldwell said.

And why would Caldwell say it wasn't intentional if he hasn't seen it yet?

"I get briefed on it," he said. "Guys look at it and tell me what they thought, what they saw, so that's it. Don't think it's intentional. End of story."

Caldwell said he's not concerned about the mind-set of his team, despite high-profile extracurriculars in back-to-back weeks that have left Detroit vulnerable to suspensions during the most critical stretch of the season.

"I'm not worried at all," he said.

Suh's play drew a ton of heat on social media, with all kinds of experts and analysts weighing in, including noted rapper Lil Wayne.

Starting the New Year on a good note means skipping the stress—especially when it comes to your hair! But since many of us will be working in the hours leading up to the ball drop (often with little to no time to adjust between office and party) our suggestion is to prep your locks in the AM. With the right style and a few night-appropriate tricks, your hair won't need much upkeep to make it to midnight.

Loose Waves

Start with structured waves in the morning, wrapping small sections of hair (1-1 1/2-inch pieces) around a 1-inch curling iron for 20 to 30 seconds. Brush the ringlets out and throughout the day, they’ll smooth to soft waves. After work, apply a texturizing spray into the hair, spraying and scrunching each section to increase volume.

Glam Topknot

The secret to a topknot is in the volume. In the morning apply a generous amount of dry shampoo from the scalp to the tip, scrunching the hair to add fullness. Then pull the hair up into a twisted topknot towards the top of the head. Hold with hairspray. At night, either pull a few front pieces out to soften the look or add a glitzy headband.

Messy Fishtail

Pull off a lived-in braid the natural way. Start with a clean fishtail braid in the morning and let it naturally transition to messy-chic—pieces will fall out of the plait over time. At the end of the day, use a dry shampoo at the roots to make the entire style look lived in. Add a bow or leather cuff at the tip of the braid for subtle structure.

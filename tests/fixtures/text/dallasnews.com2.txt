Twenty years from now, will we look back on photos such as the one above and wonder why in the world we considered that to be “sport”?

A new poll by Bloomberg News indicates Americans are continuing to inch in that direction.

It’s more comfortable to look past the head injury issue, especially this time of year. We have high school playoffs to cheer. And a packed college bowl schedule, exciting for everyone even if your school didn’t get into the game you thought it deserved. (Baylor and TCU fans, hope you saw our editorial on that topic.) And the NFL continues to score big by most any measure, regardless of its many missteps. (Hey, we wrote about that too.)

But new research, commissioned by Bloomberg Politics, is the latest indicator that parents are increasingly refusing to let their sons play the sport. Just last month, our own sports department produced a revealing special report on former Dallas Cowboy stars and their discomfort with their sons following in their footsteps.

Overall, the Bloomberg data shows that half of the respondents don’t want their sons playing football. What’s most eye-opening — and troubling — is that the percentage who don’t want their sons participating goes up a lot among those who are college-educated (62 percent) and who make over $100,00 (also 62 percent).

While I’ve read lots of arguments about sports being a decent vehicle for young lower-income teens to ride into a better life, I hate to think of us all enjoying a game that likely will become increasingly populated by those whose parents aren’t educated about the risks. Polls such as Bloomberg’s leave me feeling a bit like we’ve got a growing caste system in this sport.

One bright note in the survey: 58 percent of women (as opposed to 41 percent of men) oppose their sons playing football. That number includes moms of all educational and financial backgrounds.

We’re a long way from becoming a nation of flag football supporters, but I hope the momentum grows for finding ways to create a sport that is a lot less violent.

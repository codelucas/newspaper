Google doesn't just have a new logo today: the creative web company has also hidden a surprise on its homepage.

Go to Google.com today and click "I'm Feeling Lucky" (without entering a search term) to get an unexpected treat.

Is today's hidden gem just for fun, or a subtle reminder to visit Google.com once in awhile?

The Louisville Cardinals hosted the Kentucky Wildcats on Saturday for one of the 2014 season’s most highly anticipated college basketball games.

Rick Pitino’s 4th ranked Cardinals have had a great start to the season, but they were still huge underdogs against John Calipari’s unbeaten powerhouse. (RELATED: Kentucky Basketball’s Christmas Card Must Be Pretty Intimidating For Opposing Teams)

Louisville trailed by 4 points at halftime, but they couldn’t close the gap thanks to plays like this.

WATCH:

Slow it down one time.

What a joke.

In games like these, I usually cheer for the underdog, but that flop had me wanting Kentucky to win by fifty. (RELATED: Forget ISIS, China And Immigrants; Flopping Is Threatening To Destroy America)

Like the rest of their games this season, the Wildcats eventually pulled away from their cross-state rival. UK won by a final score of 58-50.

On a side note, apparently Jennifer Lawrence is a Cardinals fan.

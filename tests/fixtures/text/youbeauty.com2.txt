I have confused skin. One moment it is dry and needs hydration and the next it is oily and greasy. So I need a powder that will cut the oil, but still let my skin breathe. Clinique Acne Solutions Powder Makeup gently covers blemishes, evens skin and even absorbs oil to leave skin looking fresh. It's made specifically for "dry combination to oily skin types," so it may be just what I have been looking for.

Product: Clinique Acne Solutions Powder Makeup

Price: $31.00

How to Use it: The powder comes with a sponge applicator, but feel free to apply it with a powder brush as well. Apply to oily spots only or use the powder on your entire face for full-coverage. (It's also available in liquid form.)

Results: The shade that I received as a trial, Golden, was a bit too dark for my complexion, but I'm expecting to get a tan soon on a trip to the tropics. That aside, my skin has been in its oily phase for the past few days, so I was super excited to see if Clinique's Acne Solutions Powder Makeup really delivered â€” and it definitely did! The powder immediately cut the shine and gave my skin an even, natural look. It is very light and even thought it builds on your skin, it doesn't look or feel "caked on" like some powders do. I will be purchasing it for myself in the future, although maybe in a lighter shade.

Disclaimer: I received Clinique Acne Solutions Powder as a sample.

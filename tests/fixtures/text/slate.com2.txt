The biggest challenge to Brazil’s World Cup preparations over the past few weeks has been the chaos caused by striking public workers . While São Paulo subway workers voted to at least temporarily suspend their strikes on Monday night, protests by activists angry at the money being spent by Brazil to host the event are expected to continue throughout the World Cup .

Though nowhere near the size of last year’s broad-based social movement, which brought millions to the streets, protests have been building back up in recent months. The tournament, which begins Thursday in São Paulo, has reportedly cost in excess of $11 billion, money protesters say could have been spent on public infrastructure. The movement has already produced its share of powerful images. Here are some of the most striking photos.

Oh, RiRi. You truly are an icon.

When Rihanna walks into a fashion show, even editors, publicists, other celebs gasp. Gasp they did on Friday and Saturday as the cooler-than-thou-crooner sashayed into her costume designer Adam Selman's show, as well as those of Joseph Altuzarra and Alexander Wang. And she did not disappoint. Let's take a look at what she wore:



At Adam Selman, RiRi rocked an elegant and girly white A-line dress with pearls and my favorite Christian Louboutin strappy pumps.



For Altuzarra, she glammed out in super sophistication with a plunging black jacket with fringe from the designer's collection—WITHOUT PANTS. I LOVE IT.



At Alexander Wang, she brought out her inner '90s child with a matching midnight blue hoodie and skirt.

Are you a Rihhana fan? I love her. Now where's my plunging black jacket? Not to fret—I will wear pants.

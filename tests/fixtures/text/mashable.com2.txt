Planes on the tarmac were also affected, as passengers had to wait because of the outage. The airport was dispatching buses to take passengers back and forth.

Can't get off the plane. Actually it's not Ryanair's fault. It's Stansted's. Apparently there's a power cut.... — Jackzelia Banks (@JackieRue) December 22, 2014

The airport reported that crews had restored power at about 5:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. EST).

Power has now been restored. Flights continue to operate but are subject to delay. We apologise to all passengers delayed this afternoon — Stansted Airport (@STN_Airport) December 22, 2014

While much smaller than Heathrow or Gatwick airports in London, Stansted had its busiest November in eight years last month with more than 1.5 million passengers.

Stansted Airport reported that there were some delays, but flights are operating. FlightAware was not reporting a large number of delays in the early afternoon.

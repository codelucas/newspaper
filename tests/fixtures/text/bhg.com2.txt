A pretty wreath, is just the trick to take your Christmas decorations from basic to bold. Here are the no fail secrets, for hanging window, and door wreaths. For outdoor wreaths, choose a ribbon that's strong, durable, and will make a high impact statement. Your best bet, is a two and half inch satin ribbon. To avoid a droopy look, hang your wreath in the top half of the window. On a door, center the wreath at about eye level. To hang a wreath in a window, lower the top window sash and place the wreath outside of the window while holding the ends of the length of the hanging ribbon.

When hanging on a door, use a staple gun, to staple the ends of the hanging ribbon to the center top of the door. That way, the staples will never be seen. To keep a lightweight wreath in place, use double-sided foam tape on the back. It's that simple. Use this method every Christmas, to hang your wreath without damaging your home. [MUSIC]

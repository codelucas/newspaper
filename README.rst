Get it now
----------

Run ✅ ``pip3 install newspaper3k`` ✅

NOT ⛔ ``pip3 install newspaper`` ⛔

On python3 you must install ``newspaper3k``, **not** ``newspaper``. ``newspaper`` is our python2 library.
Although installing newspaper is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_, you will
run into fixable issues if you are trying to install on ubuntu.

**If you are on Debian / Ubuntu**, install using the following:

- Install ``pip3`` command needed to install ``newspaper3k`` package::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

- Python development version, needed for Python.h::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev

- lxml requirements::

    $ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

- For PIL to recognize .jpg images::

    $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev

NOTE: If you find problem installing ``libpng12-dev``, try installing ``libpng-dev``.

- Download NLP related corpora::

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python3

- Install the distribution via pip::

    $ pip3 install newspaper3k

**If you are on OSX**, install using the following, you may use both homebrew or macports:

::

    $ brew install libxml2 libxslt

    $ brew install libtiff libjpeg webp little-cms2

    $ pip3 install newspaper3k

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python3


**Otherwise**, install with the following:

NOTE: You will still most likely need to install the following libraries via your package manager

- PIL: ``libjpeg-dev`` ``zlib1g-dev`` ``libpng12-dev``
- lxml: ``libxml2-dev`` ``libxslt-dev``
- Python Development version: ``python-dev``

::

    $ pip3 install newspaper3k

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codelucas/newspaper/master/download_corpora.py | python3

Development
-----------

If you'd like to contribute and hack on the newspaper project, feel free to clone
a development version of this repository locally::

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package,
or install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    $ python3 setup.py install

Feel free to give our testing suite a shot, everything is mocked!::

    $ python3 tests/unit_tests.py

Planning on tweaking our full-text algorithm? Add the ``fulltext`` parameter::

    $ python3 tests/unit_tests.py fulltext
